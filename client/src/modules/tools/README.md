# Tools Module

## Purpose

Provides the PDF Tools UI for combining, splitting, and compressing existing PDF files. All processing happens server-side; the client handles file selection, configuration, and download.

## Components

- `CombineTool.jsx`
  Upload 1+ PDF files, extract individual pages into a visual grid, rearrange them via high-performance native drag-and-drop or position dropdowns, and merge into a single PDF download.

- `SplitTool.jsx`
  Upload a single PDF, choose a split mode (custom ranges, every page, or extract specific pages), download result as ZIP or single PDF.

- `CompressTool.jsx`
  Upload a single PDF, compress via structural optimization, display original vs compressed size and percentage reduction.

## Implemented behavior

- Each tool uses `fetch()` to POST multipart form data to the corresponding server endpoint.
- File inputs accept `application/pdf` only.
- Combine tool parses PDFs locally (using `pdfjs-dist`) to generate visual page thumbnails asynchronously. It supports adding multiple files incrementally and allows reordering at the specific page-level via native drag-and-drop or dropdowns.
- Split tool supports three modes: custom ranges (`1-3,5,7-9`), every page (each page → separate file), and extract specific pages.
- Compress tool reads `X-Original-Size`, `X-Compressed-Size`, and `X-Reduction-Percent` response headers to display stats.
- All tools show loading state during processing and user-facing error messages on failure.
- Download is triggered via a temporary `<a>` element with `download` attribute and `blob:` URL.

## Server endpoints used

| Tool | Endpoint | Response |
|------|----------|----------|
| Combine | `POST /api/pdf/merge` | Merged PDF |
| Split | `POST /api/pdf/split` | PDF or ZIP |
| Compress | `POST /api/pdf/compress` | Compressed PDF + headers |

## Current status

- All three tools are fully functional.
- Compression is structural only (object stream optimization); image recompression is not yet implemented.
